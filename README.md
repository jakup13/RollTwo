# RollTwo
My score keeper another idea...

The game rules are:
- 2 Players
- Player rolls 2 dices at a time and clicks on appropriate buttons (e.g. dices 2 and 5 - buttons 2 and 5 and 7 as a result)
- The result doubles whet Player gains doubled dices (e.g. 4 and 4, no matter what number of dots, it just doubles the result)
- and so on.
Maybe it should have a time limit (counter) or limited ammount of moves / throws to make?
It's just an idea and some learning.
